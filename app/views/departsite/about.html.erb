        			The Electrical Department of Niger Delta University was formally established in the 2001/2002 academic
session, when it admitted its first set of students. The programme awards the bachelor of engineering
(B.Eng.) in Electrical/Electronic Engineering after five academic sessions, and graduated its first set of
engineers in the 2005/2006 academic year. Several young graduates have returned to the department as
graduate assistants under the University’s staff development programme to beef up the staff strength of
the Department.</p>
        			<h6 class = "news-date">PHYLOSOPHY</h6><p>
        			The five year Bachelor of Engineering (B.Eng.) programme aims to provide students with knowledge of the
fundamentals of electrical and electronics engineering, and includes modules on mathematics, power
engineering, electrical drives and machines, high voltage and switchgears, transmission and distribution of
electrical power, computer engineering, logic, analogue and digital electronics, extensive selection of
courses in communications and semiconductor devices among others. It is evident that
telecommunications world-wide has seen an explosive growth over the past decade and Nigeria in
particular, has seen a spectacular growth in mobile and personal communications, as well as the use of
VSAT. For this reason, speech, text, data and multimedia services are now widely available. Thus the
department focuses on the need to urgently develop adequate manpower in this regard, by vigorously
focusing on the areas of telecommunications especially mobile and personal communication as well as
antennas and propagation. In the electrical power sector, the department offers a wide selection of courses
and is particularly interested in training engineers that will not only compete successfully for jobs in the
electrical power industry but also well equipped for university teaching and research. Alternative energy
sources such solar, wind-energy, photovoltaic and other areas such as wireless transmission of electric
power are also receiving attention.</p>

<h6 class = "news-date">AIM/OBJECTIVES</h6>
	<p>The programme is designed such that all graduating students must have achieved the following:
	<ul>
<li> An ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering.</li>
<li> An ability to design and conduct engineering and scientific experiments.</li>
<li> An ability to analyze and interpret engineering and scientific data.</li>
<li>An ability to design, including the planning, specification, detailed design, implementation, and
evaluation of components, processes, or systems to meet performance, cost, safety, and quality
requirements.</li>
<li> An ability to function on multi-disciplinary teams.</li>
<li>An ability to identify, formulate and solve a range of electrical engineering problems and an
understanding of professional and ethical responsibility.</li>
<li> An ability to convey technical material through formal written papers/reports. Knowledge of electrical
engineering fundamental concepts, with advanced knowledge in at least one sub-discipline of
electrical engineering.</li>
<li>Knowledge of mathematics through differential and integral calculus.</li>
The department aims to produce Electrical and Electronics Engineers who will help to Design, Develop and
Test products as well as provide services that will meet world-wide standard for quality. Students entering
the programme are expected demonstrate competence in Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry. They are
also expected to demonstrate ability to think critically. Because a good command of English language in
both written and spoken form is critical to success both as an Engineer and Research Scholar. Students are
required to possess a satisfactory command of verbal and written English. Other courses from the
Humanities and management are also included. This way, our engineering graduates will function well in a
broad range of professional activities, such as teaching research and development, design, manufacturing,
testing an d commissioning, maintenance, operation, marketing, sales and management. The five-year
programme is divided into nine semesters, during which period students attend lectures, tutorials, and take
practical’s; as well as attend to their projects. Another semester is spent on industrial attachment. Because
the grading system reflects this division, students are usually required to participate fully in every one of
these activities.
The industrial training aspect of the degree programme is divided into four parts. This division is shown
below as part of the schedule of courses. Students get the benefit of hand-on experience of real world
engineering problems. Entrepreneurial development has been integrated into our programme. The
Electrical and Electronic Engineering Department undertakes a periodic review of its programme as a
policy; and the current review has benefited from comments of the NUC during its last accreditation visit.</p>
